A prototype to land in the mysterious moon of Jupiter, Europe.
First, the fuselage made of aluminium and lithium, Steel only in critical part, carbón fiber to make it support pressure, cylindrical shape and hexagons sections to make it more resistant,
to support radiation, a composed armour made out of  tungsten, in the middle of the layers water, grid-patterned lead filling that voids with polyethylene enriched with boron.
Going with energy, it would be propelled with nuclear energy. A mini reactor working with uranium pills, hafnium for control rods, wáter, and a turbine
The steam that is made, it would be used to be compressed and generating heat to propel the engines. 
at the moment of the land, it would have 4 legs made of stainless Steel, a robot who uses AI to avoid delay.
The prototype would also have a drill in order to discover the conditions of the Europa´s sea.
