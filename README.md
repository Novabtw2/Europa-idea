It´s an idea that I made to look for ways and opinions.
It´s my first post.
I explored ways to make it resistant in the adverse conditions that this moon presents.
After uploaded it, i thought another way to give it even more durability putting an hexagonal pattern after the armour layers.
I forgot to mention it, all the explanation is found as a code because I didn´t know how to publish it
